# Multidimentional-Arrays

Aim :
To study and implement 2D arrays in C++.

Theory:
A 2D array in C++ is essentially an array of arrays, meaning it stores elements in a grid or table format with rows and columns. It is particularly useful when dealing with data that naturally fits into a two-dimensional structure, such as matrices, tables, or board games.

1. Declaration and Initialization
A 2D array can be declared by specifying both the number of rows and columns. Syntax: type arrayName[rows][columns]; Example: int arr[3][4]; // Declares a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns innt arr[3][4] = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7, 8}, {9, 10, 11, 12} };

2. Accessing Elements
Elements in a 2D array are accessed using two indices: one for the row and one for the column. example: int value = arr[1][2]; // Accesses the element at row 1, column 2.

Output
Input and display

Array sum and multiplication

Array sum of diagnols

Transpose of matrix

Conclusion:
we learnt abouut 2D matrix and it's implementation.
